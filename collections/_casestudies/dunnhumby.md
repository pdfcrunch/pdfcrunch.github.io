# DunnHumby

**HuYu (receipt scanner)**

In 2018, Juan developed a receipt scanner called [HuYu](https://www.kinandcarta.com/en/case-studies/dunnhumby/) for [DunnHumby](https://www.dunnhumby.com/) (a global customer data science company), which enabled them to get a more accurate sense of consumer buying habits at the point of sale, using Google Cloud Vision and Firebase technologies.

> During my time working with Juan he proved himself to be an exceptional developer, delivering not only of
prioritised stories but also spotting opportunities to go above and beyond to deliver more value to the project.

> Juan has a calm and pleasant working manner and is very easy to work with, listening to client demands and
turning them into reality in the App.

> He has outstanding knowledge of working with mobile apps on GCP and Firebase and can explain what heâ€™s
done in simple terms. For example, he will take time to make simple to follow video illustrations to explain the
solution so that it be understood by everyone.

> Juan has been a pivotal team member on our project.
