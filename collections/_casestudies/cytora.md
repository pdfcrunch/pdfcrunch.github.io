# Cytora

**RiskGPT**

In 2023, Juan helped [Cytora](https://www.cytora.com/) with their goal of reducing the underwriting process from 2 weeks to 20 minutes using the latest developments in document understanding and language models.

> I really want to thank Juan for the contributions he's made to Cytora over the last year, the work we have done on LLMs has driven a compelling new direction for our product.
