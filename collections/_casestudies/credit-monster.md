# Credit Monster

**Money Finder**

In 2014, Juan developed a PDF data extraction tool for [Credit Monster](https://creditmonster.com/), which extracts monies owed to individuals from millions of state-level documents. The tool was eventually integrated with Credit Monster's [Money Finder](https://creditmonster.com/money-finder).

> Hire Juan if you want to supercharge your project, or more generally if you value dedication and quality
craftsmanship.
