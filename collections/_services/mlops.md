# MLOps

Our MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) capabilities will help you take your machine learning models to production, with continued maintenance and monitoring.

This service offers clients a comprehensive package to deploy, monitor, and maintain machine learning models at scale. It incorporates our knowledge in multi-GPU training and inference, building transformer-based applications, and hosting with SaaS or NVidia Triton. Ideal for clients looking to streamline their ML lifecycle with expert guidance.

We can help you with:
- **Model Deployment** - Deploy your machine learning models to production.
- **Model Monitoring** - Monitor your machine learning models to ensure they are performing as expected.
- **Model Maintenance** - Maintain your machine learning models to ensure they are up-to-date and continue to perform well.

Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC), use our cloud, or deploy your model on-premises.

- **BYOC** - we have experience deploying models to AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- **Our Cloud** - we can deploy your model to our cloud using GCP.
- **On-Premises** - we can deploy your model on-premise using the latest technology from NVidia to ensure efficient utilisation of your hardware.

We can consult on specialist activities such as:

- **Human In The Loop** - we can help you build systems that require human intervention to ensure the model continuously learns and improves.
