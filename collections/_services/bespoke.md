# Bespoke Development & Consulting

[Contact us](/contact/) for a free initial consultation on how we can help you with your AI, ML and data needs. We can then advise on next steps, and provide a quote for our services.


Bespoke work we've done for other clients:
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for a client with a large in-house knowledge base
- AI-powered chatbots for immediate customer service
- Enriching NPC interactions in digital environments, making use of platforms like the Godot game engine

We can also consult on:

- language models
  - retrieval augmentation
  - fine-tuning
  - tool usage
  - prompt engineering (as fine-tuning is not always the best approach)
